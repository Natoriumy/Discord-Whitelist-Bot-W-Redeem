# Discord-Whitelist-Bot-W-Redeem

Hello, it was one of my discord bot for one of my whitelists made by IHaxU ( He is one of the guys which helped me in start, thanks you, even though you ignore me now, i still like) </br>

Now to main process, how this does work? </br> 

1. For first of all, post keys in a site so we can read keys through key variable, it can be url or just a text file, used in main.py, every key in keys text document need to be based on new line.
2. Create "Buyer" Role in the discord server, our bot needs to be higher than this role to give people this role.
3. Now just put a token of the discord and run the main.py

Buyers side: 
1. Need to use .redeem <key>
2. Need to use .getrole to get Buyer role 



Thanks for reading!
