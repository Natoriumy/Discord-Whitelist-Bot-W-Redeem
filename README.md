# Discord-Whitelist-Bot-W-Redeem

Hello, it was one of my discord bots for one of my whitelists made by IHaxU ( He is one of the guys who helped me in the start, thank you, even though you ignore me now, I still like you) </br>
Now to the main process, how this does work?

1. For first of all, post keys in a site so we can read keys through key variable, it can be url or just a text file, used in main.py, every key in keys text document need to be based on new line.

2. Create a "Buyer" Role in the discord server, our bot needs to be higher than this role to give people this role.

3. Now just put a token of the discord and run the main.py

Buyers side:

1. Need to use .redeem

2. Need to use .getrole to get Buyer role



Thanks for reading!
